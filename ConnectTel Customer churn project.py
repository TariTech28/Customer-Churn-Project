# ## Features in the dataset and meaning
# 
# - CustomerID:
# A unique identifier assigned to each telecom customer, enabling
# tracking and identification of individual customers.
# - Gender:
# The gender of the customer, which can be categorized as male, or
# female. This information helps in analyzing gender based trends in
# customer churn.
# - SeniorCitizen:
# A binary indicator that identifies whether the customer is a senior citizen
# or not. This attribute helps in understanding if there are any specific
# churn patterns among senior customers.
# - Partner:
# Indicates whether the customer has a partner or not. This attribute helps
# in evaluating the impact of having a partner on churn behavior.
# - Dependents:
# Indicates whether the customer has dependents or not. This attribute
# helps in assessing the influence of having dependents on customer
# churn.
# - Tenure:
# The duration for which the customer has been subscribed to the telecom
# service. It represents the loyalty or longevity of the customerâ€™s
# relationship with the company and is a significant predictor of churn.
# - PhoneService:
# Indicates whether the customer has a phone service or not. This attribute
# helps in understanding the impact of phone service on churn.
# - MultipleLines:
# Indicates whether the customer has multiple lines or not. This attribute helps in analyzing
# the effect of having multiple lines on customer churn.
# - InternetService:
# Indicates the type of internet service subscribed by the customer, such as DSL, fiber optic,
# or no internet service. It helps in evaluating the relationship between internet service and
# churn.
# - OnlineSecurity:
# Indicates whether the customer has online security services or not. This attribute helps in
# analyzing the impact of online security on customer churn.
# - OnlineBackup:
# Indicates whether the customer has online backup services or not. This attribute helps in
# evaluating the impact of online backup on churn behavior.
# - DeviceProtection:
# Indicates whether the customer has device protection services or not. This attribute helps
# in understanding the influence of device protection on churn.
# - TechSupport:
# Indicates whether the customer has technical support services or not. This attribute helps
# in assessing the impact of tech support on churn behavior.
# - StreamingTV:
# Indicates whether the customer has streaming TV services or not. This attribute helps in
# evaluating the impact of streaming TV on customer churn.
# - StreamingMovies:
# Indicates whether the customer has streaming movie services or not. This attribute helps in understanding the influence
# of streaming movies on churn behavior.
# - Contract:
# Indicates the type of contract the customer has, such as a month to month, one year, or two year contract. It is a crucial
# factor in predicting churn as different contract lengths may have varying impacts on customer loyalty.
# - PaperlessBilling:
# Indicates whether the customer has opted for paperless billing or not. This attribute helps in analyzing the effect of
# paperless billing on customer churn.
# - PaymentMethod:
# Indicates the method of payment used by the customer, such as electronic checks, mailed checks, bank transfers, or credit
# cards. This attribute helps in evaluating the impact of payment methods on churn.
# - MonthlyCharges:
# The amount charged to the customer on a monthly basis. It helps in understanding the relationship between monthly
# charges and churn behavior.
# - TotalCharges:
# The total amount charged to the customer over the entire tenure. It represents the cumulative revenue generated from the
# customer and may have an impact on churn.
# - Churn:
# The target variable indicates whether the customer has churned (canceled the service) or not. It is the main variable to
# predict in telecom customer churn analysis.

# ## NOTE
# 1. SeniorCitizen:
# - Count:
# Indicates that there are 7,043 records in the dataset.
# - Mean:
# The mean of 0.162 suggests that around 16.2% of the customers are senior citizens.
# - Standard Deviation:
# With a standard deviation of 0.369, there is some variability in the distribution of senior citizens.
# - min-max
# Provides the range of values: 0 (non-senior) and 1 (senior).

# - Customers with higher monthly and total charges are more likely to churn.
# - Customers who are on long-term contracts and have opted for paperless billing are less likely to churn.
# - Senior citizens are more likely to churn, while customers who have online security, device protection, tech support, streaming TV, and streaming movie services are less likely to churn.

# ## Note
# In Conclusion, the Logistic Regression model has the highest ROC score at 70.38%. This means that the model is 70.38% accurate at distinguishing between churners and non-churners.
# 
# Overall, the results suggest that all of the models are able to distinguish between churners and non-churners with reasonable accuracy.

# ## Business Recommendations
# 
# The company should be more concerned with reducing false negatives. This is because false negatives can lead to lost revenue and customer loyalty. When a customer churns, the company loses the recurring revenue that the customer was generating. Additionally, churned customers are more likely to leave negative reviews and spread negative word-of-mouth, which can damage the company's reputation.
# 
# To reduce false negatives, the company should focus on improving the recall of their churn prediction model.
